<h3>Feburary 1945 - The Yalta Conference</h3>
<p>
      The Yalta Conference was a conference tahing place during Febuary of 1945.
      The conference was in a Russian resort town, and Franklin D. Roosevelt,
      Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin met to make decisions about the war.
      
      The three agreed on splitting Germany into four zones. The USSR obtained
      East Germany, and France, the United States, and Britain would get West Germany.
      The United States would obtain an agreement from the USSR to assist in the fight
      against Japan, and defined policy for the regions liberated during World War II.

      The conference was important because it was when the USSR officially had control over
      Eastern Europe, and was recognized by the United States and Great Britain.

      This was considered to be the beginning of the Cold War in Europe.

<h3>July 1945 - The Potsdam Conference</h3>
<p>
      The Potsdam Conference, similar to the Yalta conference, was a meeting
      between the leaders of the United States, Great Britain, and the USSR.
      However, the President has changed â€” now Harry Truman is in office.
      The conference took place in Potsdam, Germany, with the goal to negotiate
      the terms for the end of World War II.

      At the Yalta conference, Stalin had argued for German to pay heavy reparations,
      of which half would go to the Soviet Union. While Roosevelt had agreed to this,
      Truman wanted to decrease the reparations in order to avoid situation similar
      to the one created with the Treaty of Versilles.

      As part of this conference, Poland recieved a large section of previously German
      land, then deported millions of Germans who were living on that land.

      This was also when Truman revealed that the United States had detonated an atomic bomb
      to Stalin. However, due to Stalin's extensive intelligence network, this was not news to him.

    <h3>February 1946 - Stalin's speech</h3>
    <p>
      On February 9, 1946, Stalin delivered a speech to voters in the Stalin
      Electoral District in Moscow. In this meeting, he blames the capitalist
      system for World War II. He suggests that wars could be avoided if resources
      were distributed between countries in an even way, but that is impossible under
      capitalism.
      
      He goes on to suggest that capitalism caused World War I as well. He says that
      World War II proved that the Soviet socialist system could work, and that the
      United States and Great Britain respected the new Red Army.

      He also encouraged voting for the Communist Party in the upcoming elections.

    <h3>Febuary 1946 - The "Long Telegram"</h3>
    <p>
      The "Long Telegram" was a telegram sent by George Kennan to the Secretary of State.
      The name comes from the fact that it was abnormally long &mdash; extending over 5,000 words.
      Sent from the Soviet Union, Kennan describes the harsh Soviet foreign policies.
      Kennan also sent his recommendations for changes to U.S. policy. He sugessted
      to educate (dubious) the public about the situation with Russia,
      and also to help guide other countries.

      He also notes that "World communism is like malignant parasite which feeds only on diseased tissue."
