    NATO was an alliance created in 1949 in order to combat the Soviets.
    USSR as a collective. The NATO Treaty was created in order to support
    European countries with protection from the Soviet Union and a potential
    German uprising. Eventually, the final version of the North Atlantic Treaty
    was signed in 1949 by 12 nations. The nations would support each other in the
    case of an attack against any member. This clause was especially important due
    to the United State's ownership of nuclear weapons, alongside NATO's
    collective adoption of "massive retaliation" principles. The combination
    of these two factors was meant to deter the Soviet Union from attacking.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1955, the members of NATO agreed to add the Federal Republic of Germany,
    also known as "West Germany," to the treaty. This action led to the Soviet
    Union's creation of a similar alliance, known as the Warsaw Pact.

      The Warsaw Pact was established in May of 1995 in retaliation against NATO.
      It consisted of the USSR, and some surrounding countries. These nations included
      Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.
      The treaty had similar effects to the North Atlantic Treaty, with each member
      coming to the defense of the others in the case of an attack.

    <p>
      The Warsaw Pact is sometimes referred to as the "eastern bloc", while NATO is
      the "western bloc."

    NATO and the Warsaw Pact did not directly engage in war. However, there was a weapons
    race, with each alliance trying to overpass the other.
